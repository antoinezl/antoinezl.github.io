### End of studies project: 6 months internship at INRA (Plaisir Grignon, [AMPC Team]()) under the supervision of [Nicolas Lapalu]() and [Richard O'Connell]().

### "Projet Long": RNA Feature extraction, programming project in collaboration with PTER and [Costas Bouyioukos]().

As part of the **Master's courses**, I collabored with the **PTER (Post Transcription ) Team** at Université Paris Diderot. The aim of the project was **to develop a tool that can allow one to extract defined features having a key role in determining whether a mRNA is commonly regulated or not**. This collaboration took place during the first semester of my second year of Master's degree. 

I was able to deliver a RNA feature extraction tool which takes **ENSEMBL ids** as input (as a list of ids) or a unique ID. The tool consists in 2 seperate **Python scripts** (**geneID2fasta.py** and **fasta2table.py**) and a library of functions called by the two previous scripts (**rnaFeaturesLib.py**).

The tool returns large datasets of RNA features (Kozak sequence and context, folding energy of the UTRs, length of each UTRs, etc.) that can be used for further analyses.

**_NOTE_**: The code (regulary updated, as other students are now working on the project) is available [**HERE**](https://github.com/parisepigenetics/rna_feat_ext/tree/develop_consolidation/mouse).
